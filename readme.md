## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js installed on your environement. It is also recomended to use Yarn for dependency management (my preferences)

#### Node installation on Windows

Just go on [official Node.js website](http://nodejs.org/) & grab the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` and `yarn` might need it.
